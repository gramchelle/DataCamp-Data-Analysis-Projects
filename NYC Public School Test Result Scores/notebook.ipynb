There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the CSV file.\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Save your results in a pandas DataFrame called best_math_schools, including \"school_name\" and \"average_math\" columns, sorted by \"average_math\" in descending order.\n\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"] >= 0.8 * 800][[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].sort_values(\"average_math\", ascending= False)\nschools[\"total_SAT\"] = schools[\"average_math\"] + schools[\"average_writing\"]+ schools[\"average_reading\"]\n\n# Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called top_10_schools containing the \"school_name\" and a new column named \"total_SAT\", with results ordered by \"total_SAT\" in descending order.\n\ntop_10_schools = schools[[\"school_name\",\"total_SAT\"]].sort_values(\"total_SAT\", ascending=False).head(10)\n\n# Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?
